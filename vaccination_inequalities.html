      <div class="content">
        <p>This section has been produced to explore inequalities or differences in vaccination uptake among different groups, be it different age groups or people in different geographical areas.</p>
        <p>Not all age groups are currently being invited for a vaccination and so it can be simply that those areas with lower uptake have more people in younger groups or have less people from clinically extremely vulnerable or health and social care staff groups. <b>As such, it is important to look at those groups where we expect all individuals should have been invited (e.g. those aged 50 and over and those aged 65 and over who have been eligible for some weeks now).</b></p>
        <p>In addition to geographical differences, we explore measures of deprivation and how this may relate to vaccination uptake locally.</p> 
        <p>In addition to local variation, we also explore variation in uptake among different ethnic groups, although this is at a wider Integrated Care System (ICS) / Sustainability Transformation Partnership (STP) of Residence (of which Sussex Health and Care Partnership covers the whole of Sussex). Ethnicity data is not available at a more granular or local level and there are currently no denominator or population estimates available to indicate the proportions of uptake among these groups.</p>
        <p>Finally, we explore potential inequalities in access to vaccination sites across the Sussex area.</p>
        <p>Each week, NHS England publish additional data on vaccine uptake, with new age groups being added as more people are vaccinated. It is possible that </p>

      <div class="content">
  
        <p>The table below shows the local areas with the lowest uptake of at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccination.</p>
        <p>You can filter and sort this table. By default, it shows neighbourhoods (MSOA's) in the whole of Sussex. You can sort by all age, over 50's and over 65's uptake in vaccination.</p>

        <p>We first show the current vaccination sites operating in the Sussex area. The table below shows the number of sites open in each district and the map shows these sites by the type (GP led service, hospital hub, pharmacy, or vaccination centre).</p>
        <p>You can toggle the background of the map to show the Indices of Multiple Deprivation (a measure of neighbourhood deprivation) to indicate which sites are in or close to areas of higher deprivation as well as an indicator of how rural or urban each area is.</p>
        <p>Of course, each site will not just vaccinate the people in the immediate local area, but understanding how far away available sites are from areas which are more deprived may help to explore opportunities to increase uptake in those areas.</p>
