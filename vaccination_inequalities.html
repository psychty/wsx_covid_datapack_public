      <div class="content">
        <p>
          This section has been produced to explore inequalities or differences
          in vaccination uptake among different groups, be it different age
          groups or people in different geographical areas.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not all age groups are currently being invited for a vaccination and
          so it can be simply that those areas with lower uptake have more
          people in younger groups or have less people from clinically extremely
          vulnerable or health and social care staff groups.
          <b
            >As such, it is important to look at those groups where we expect
            all individuals should have been invited (e.g. those aged 50 and
            over and those aged 65 and over who have been eligible for some
            weeks now).</b
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to geographical differences, we explore measures of
          deprivation and how this may relate to vaccination uptake locally.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to local variation, we also explore variation in uptake
          among different ethnic groups, although this is at a wider Integrated
          Care System (ICS) / Sustainability Transformation Partnership (STP) of
          Residence (of which Sussex Health and Care Partnership covers the
          whole of Sussex). Ethnicity data is not available at a more granular
          or local level and there are currently no denominator or population
          estimates available to indicate the proportions of uptake among these
          groups.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, we explore potential inequalities in access to vaccination
          sites across the Sussex area.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each week, NHS England publish additional data on vaccine uptake, with
          new age groups being added as more people are vaccinated. It is
          possible that

        Local vaccination uptake and deprivation
      </h4>
      <div class="content">
        <p>
          A measure of local (neighbourhood) relative deprivation is available
          from the Ministry of Housing, Communities & Local Government which
          classifies small areas as more or less deprived compared to others.
          More information is
          <a
            href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/english-indices-of-deprivation-2019"
            >available here</a
          >.
        </p>
        <p>
          The IMD 2019 score is provided at Lower layer Super Output Area (LSOA)
          level, and we have used population weighted averages to aggregate this
          up to Middle layer Super Output Area (MSOA) level to coincide with the
          geography at which vaccination statistics are published.
        </p>
        <p>
          The IMD 2019 ranks areas from most (rank of 1) to least (rank of
          6,791) deprived nationally. We have also calculated ranks within
          Sussex (Brighton and Hove, East Sussex, and West Sussex MSOAs)
        </p>

        <p></p>
        <p>
          Looking at the map above gives us some idea that there may be lower
          uptake among areas where there is considered to be relatively more
          deprivation.
        </p>
        <p>
          We can explore this relationship a bit further by plotting each
          neighbourhood on a scatterplot (below) which has deprivation along the
          bottom (from left to right) and percentage uptake along the side (from
          bottom to top).

          We first show the current vaccination sites operating in the Sussex

          You can toggle the background of the map to show the Indices of
          Multiple Deprivation (a measure of neighbourhood deprivation) to
          indicate which sites are in or close to areas of higher deprivation as
          well as an indicator of how rural or urban each area is.
        </p> -->
        <p>
          Of course, each site will not just vaccinate the people in the
          immediate local area, but understanding how far away available sites
          are from areas which are more deprived may help to explore
          opportunities to increase uptake in those areas.
