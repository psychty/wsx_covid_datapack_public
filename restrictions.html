      <!-- <div class="content">
     <p>Following a national lockdown in England between 5th November 2020 to 2nd December 2020 areas returned to a tiered system allocating each local authority across the country to one of three tiers with a review of each areas placement every 14 days. However, on Saturday 20th December, the UK Government announced a fourth tier (Stay at home) to try to limit the spread of rapidly rising rates of COVID-19.</p>
     <p>West Sussex has been placed in the highest tier <b>(Stay at home tier 4)</b>. A full breakdown of the Tier 2 restrictions can be found on the <a href = 'https://www.gov.uk/guidance/local-restriction-tiers-what-you-need-to-know'>GOV.UK website</a>.</p>
     <p>The map below shows how restrictions vary across England. Tier 1 areas are shaded yellow, whilst Tier 2 areas are light blue, Tier 3 (very high) is dark blue and the highest tier (Tier 4 - stay at home) is purple.</p>
     <div id = 'ltla_restrictions_map'></div>
     <p>The map covers restrictions outlined by the UK government for England. Local authorities also have statutory powers to issue "directions" which impose prohibitions or restrictions on premises, events and public spaces.</p> 
   </div>
     <h4 class = 'content_top'>Returning to schools in 2021</h4>
     <div class = 'content'>
     <p>On the 30th December 2020, the Department for Education set out new guidance for schools and childcare settings. Its premise is to enable settings to prepare programmes for testing staff and pupils over the coming weeks using lateral flow device tests.</p>
     <p>To support this, the guidance indicates that in the week commencing 4th January 2021, secondary schools should only provide education on site to vulnerable children and children of critical workers whilst prioritising remote education to those pupils in exam years and where possible other pupils. The following week (commencing 11th January), remote education should be available to all pupils and all pupils should expect to return to on site education from the 18th January.</p>
     <p>Primary schools in some local authorities are also requested to restrict on site education to children of critical workers and vulnerable children with a review of restrictions by the 18th January 2021.</p>
     <p>The map below shows which areas (highlighted in red) will have primary schools remaining closed for all but vulnerable children and children of critical workers.</p>
     <div id = 'ltla_primary_schools_map'></div>
     <p>Early years settings should be available as normal from January 2021. Shielding advice is currently in place in tier 4 areas, and so all children still deemed clinically extremely vulnerable are advised not to attend school.</p>

          On 4th January 2021, the Prime Minister announced a third national
          lockdown in England, issuing a stay at home message with education
          settings largely closed for face-to-face lessons to all except
          vulnerable children and children of critical workers
