  <h4 class = 'content_top'>West Sussex compared to the rest of England</h4>
  <div class = 'content'>
    <p id = 'wsx_growth_rate_latest'></p>
    <p id = 'england_rate_text'></p>
    <p>In addition to looking at how West Sussex compares to England overall, it is important to look at differences in neighbouring areas and local areas across the country.</p>
    </div>

   <div class = 'right-sidebar'>
    <p>This figure uses a rate per 100,000 to standardise populations across areas (because some areas are much bigger or more densely populated than others) and using a rolling 7-day period helps to smooth out any large variation in daily cases due to operational issues such as test processing at weekends.</p>
   </div> 

   <h4 class = 'content_top'>Rates across upper tier authority areas in England</h4>

  <div class = 'content'>
     <p>The first figure in this section shows the latest 7 day rate of confirmed COVID-19 cases and the change in rate across Upper Tier and Unitary Local Authority (UTLA) areas as a map, which you can zoom into using the mouse or pointer. The initial map shows the rolling 7-day incidence rate (up to the most recent date for which we believe we have complete data). You can also change the map using the buttons on the top right to show the rolling 7-day total compared to the previous period as a percentage increase or decrease as well as the cumulative number of confirmed cases so far.</p>
     <p>Interpreting the percentage change value is actually easier if an area has at least some cases each week rather than having periods with no new cases. For example, an area with zero cases one week and two cases the next is perhaps better than having one case in one week and two in the next, yet the percentage increase is impossible to show from a starting value of zero. Equally, no change can mean two weeks of no new cases, or one case each week or 10.</p>
    <p>It is important to consider each of these measures together; what are the cases now, what were the cases last week, how many cases have there been so far.</p>

    <p>The next figure shows a scatter plot of every upper tier local authority in England represented by a dot with the most recent 7-day incidence rate per 100,000 population along the x axis (from left to right) and the percentage change in cases from the previous 7 days on the y axis (from bottom to top).</p>
    <p>This is useful for seeing the current picture (compared to other areas) and how the cases have changed over the recent past and if they are decreasing or increasing. You can use the slider to look at previous days going back to the start of January 2021.</p>

    <h4>Rates and change</h4>
    <p class = 'side'>The closer to the left of the chart an areas is, the lower the 7 day incidence rate, and the closer to the bottom of the chart, the smaller the change from the previous week. If the area is below the dashed line at 0%, the number of cases is decreasing compared to the previous week.</p>
    <p>Areas closest to the dashed line show stable levels of transmission, even if they are high.</p>
