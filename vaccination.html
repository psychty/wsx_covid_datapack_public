          The COVID-19 vaccination programme began in England on the 8th
          December 2020.
        </p>
        <p>
          To begin with vaccinations were administered in NHS hospital hubs
          although from the 14th December, vaccinations were also administered
          through local vaccination services such as GP practices and then in
          care homes from the 21st December. In the new year (from 11th January
          2021) Vaccination Centres such as sports stadiums also started
          providing vaccinations.
        </p>
        <p>
          Vaccine supplies are growing as fast as possible as are the local
          centres which are delivering them. However, it is anticipated that it
          will take until summer/autumn months of 2021 before all adults have
          been offered a COVID-19 vaccine.

            It should be noted that we do not know exactly how many people have
            been offered a vaccine or how many are eligible (e.g. some health
            and social care staff of any age are eligible, or those who are
            clinically vulnerable) and so cannot say if uptake is better or
            worse in some areas than others.</b

        <p>
          The data provided by NHS England specify the number of individuals
          under the age of 25 who have been vaccinated, it is assumed that this
          figure does not include any individuals under the age of 16, as they
          are not currently eligible for vaccination. As such, the population
          denominator used excludes those aged 0-15.

      </div>

      <div class="right-sidebar">
        <p>
          The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) advise the
          government on the groups that should be prioritised for vaccination.
          JCVI advises that the first priorities for the vaccination programme
          should be the prevention of COVID-19 mortality and protecting health
          and social care staff and systems. Secondary priorities include
          vaccination of those at increased risk of hospitalisation and at
          increased risk of exposure, and to maintain resilience in essential
          public services.
        </p>
        <p class="side_important">
          On 26th February 2020, the JVCI advised that an age based population
          strategy should be adopted for further rolling out the vaccine
          programme without prioirtising new occupation groups.
        </p>
        <p class="side-important">
          For more information on the UK vaccination programme see
          <a

        <p>
          Some areas have more older people and care homes and so these areas
          will likely show as having more people with vaccinations as these
          populations were prioritised to receive.
        </p>
        <p>
          Using population estimates can help to understand coverage in the
          population. However, this does not help us to say how many people have
          had the vaccine, who are currently eligible for it, which will vary
          from area to area.
        </p>
        <p>
          The UK does not have a population register. We have used a denominator
          provided by the NIMS service for estimating the population in each
          area. These are our best guess at the number of people in the
          population, using sources such as GP practice registers and it is
          possible that they do not capture groups of people who are not
          registered with GPs including people who are homeless.

          The charts for most areas show that second doses ramped up in March
          2021 and overtook first doses throughout April, although in some areas
          first doses have now increased again as younger cohorts have openned
          up.

          There are different population demographics/structures in each area.
          Some areas have more people in the age groups that were invited first
          to have the vaccine. As such, some areas may appear to ramp up
          vaccinations at different points in time, and this may in part be due
          to the people in the area eligible for vaccinating.
        </p>
        <p>The next figure shows first doses by age group, and this broadly shows that over time, as each new age cohort opens up on the national and local booking systems over time there are spikes in vaccination doses among younger and younger cohorts.</p>

        <p>For most areas, you can see more prominent spikes among older age cohorts in the earlier months of the vaccination programme, and this is in some part due to West Sussex having an overall older age structure. To control for this, you can use the rate per 100,000 tab to show the vaccinations as an age specific rate, which allows you to more easily compare across age groups and areas.</p>
        <p>If age cohorts were accessing vaccinations equally, you might expect the rate per 100,000 peaks to be broadly similar. However, this is not always the case, with some younger cohorts not appearing to receive first dose vaccines as quickly as older cohorts.</p>
        <p>There are several factors which may explain this, including supply, capacity at vaccination sites, and appointment take up upon receiving an invitation.</p>

            The map below shows the proportion of adults aged 25 and over who have
            had at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccination. This may be more
            useful to understand inequalities in uptake across areas because all
            of those aged 25+ should receive an offer of an appointment to be
            vaccinated in the coming weeks.

        <p>
          Ensuring that vaccination coverage is high overall as well as within
          underserved communities is essential for successful delivery of the
          COVID-19 vaccination programme just like any disease control and
          elimination strategy.
        </p>
        <p>
          Inequalities are systematic differences in the status or distribution
          of resources between different population groups that are unfair or
          avoidable. We know that some groups may be more or less likely to get
          a vaccination because of factors such as access to transport,
          employment, education, ethnicity, as well as bariers related to
          language.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whilst this page contains information on uptake by age and by
          neighbourhood location across Sussex, we have created a suplementary
          analysis page to explore some of the inequalities in uptake of the
          COVID-19 vaccine that we can see using the publicly available data on
          uptake. This can be found on our
          <a href="./vaccination_inequalities.html">vaccination inequalities</a>
          page.

          The figure below shows the proportion of adults aged 16+ who have
          received a vaccine dose in West Sussex. You can use the drop down menu
          below to choose a different area or use the table below to see all
          West Sussex areas.

      <div class="content">
        <p>
          The weekly publication of vaccination data by NHS England includes
          broad age groups. Currently, whilst those in younger age groups are
          not yet eligible, anyone aged under 25 years old are grouped together.
          Over time, as more age groups become eligible for the vaccination, it
          is expected that more groups will be available.
        </p>
        <p>
          The figure below shows the number of individuals (in the orange bars)
          who have received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine in West
          Sussex by age group. This figure also includes (in the dark grey bars)
          the number of people who have yet to receive their vaccination based
          on the population estimates from the NIMS service. This show that
          among older age groups, there are relatively fewer people yet to
          receive their vaccination compared to younger groups.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is to be expected as not all age groups are eligible to receive
          the vaccine yet but the figure gives some idea of the progress to date
          and how many more people there are to offer a vaccination to.
