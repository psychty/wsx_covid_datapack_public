        <p>
          The COVID-19 vaccination programme began in England on the 8th
          December 2020.
        </p>
        <p>
          To begin with vaccinations were administered in NHS hospital hubs
          although from the 14th December, vaccinations were also administered
          through local vaccination services such as GP practices and then in
          care homes from the 21st December. In the new year (from 11th January
          2021) Vaccination Centres such as sports stadiums also started
          providing vaccinations.
        </p>
        <p>
          Vaccine supplies are growing as fast as possible as are the local
          centres which are delivering them. However, it is anticipated that it
          will take until summer/autumn months of 2021 before all adults have
          been offered a COVID-19 vaccine.
        </p>

        <p>
          The data in this section come from NHS England and are collected
          through the National Immunisation Management Service (NIMS). It is
          updated every week, on a Thursday, with data up to the previous
          Sunday.
          <b
            >As of 17th March 2021, all adults aged 50 and over are eligible for
            their first vaccination appointment.</b
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          As more age groups become eligibe for receiving the vaccine, NHS
          England will provide more information on vaccine uptake among younger
          age groups. Currently though, data is only broken down into smaller
          age groups for those aged 50 and over.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) advise the
          government on the groups that should be prioritised for vaccination.
          JCVI advises that the first priorities for the vaccination programme
          should be the prevention of COVID-19 mortality and protecting health
          and social care staff and systems. Secondary priorities include
          vaccination of those at increased risk of hospitalisation and at
          increased risk of exposure, and to maintain resilience in essential
          public services.
        </p>
        <p class="side_important">
          On 26th February 2020, the JVCI advised that an age based population
          strategy should be adopted for further rolling out the vaccine
          programme without prioirtising new occupation groups.

          * This excludes a small number of individuals where age was unknown at
          the time of vaccination. Currently, those aged under 16 are not
          eligible for the vaccine and so this cohort has been removed from the
          denominator (the population at large) in calculating the proportion
          value.
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>
            It should be noted that we do not know exactly how many people have
            been offered a vaccine or how many are eligible (e.g. some health
            and social care staff of any age are eligible, or those who are
            clinically vulnerable) and so cannot say if uptake is better or
            worse in some areas than others.</b

        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="right-sidebar">
        <p>
          Some areas have more older people and care homes and so these areas
          will likely show as having more people with vaccinations as these
          populations were prioritised to receive.
        </p>
        <p>
          Using population estimates can help to understand coverage in the
          population. However, this does not help us to say how many people have
          had the vaccine, who are currently eligible for it, which will vary
          from area to area.
        </p>
        <p>
          The UK does not have a population register. We have used a denominator
          provided by the NIMS service for estimating the population in each
          area. These are our best guess at the number of people in the
          population, using sources such as GP practice registers and it is
          possible that they do not capture groups of people who are not
          registered with GPs including people who are homeless.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h4 class="content_top">Vaccine uptake by age group</h4>

      <div class="content">
        <p>
          The weekly publication of vaccination data by NHS England includes
          broad age groups. Currently, whilst those in younger age groups are
          not yet eligible, anyone aged under 50 years old are grouped together.
          Over time, as more age groups become eligible for the vaccination, it
          is expected that more groups will be available.
        </p>
        <p>
          The figure below shows the number of individuals (in the orange bars)
          who have received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine in West
          Sussex by age group. This figure also includes (in the dark grey bars)
          the number of people who have yet to receive their vaccination based
          on the population estimates from the NIMS service. This show that
          among older age groups, there are relatively fewer people yet to
          receive their vaccination compared to younger groups.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is to be expected as not all age groups are eligible to receive
          the vaccine yet but the figure gives some idea of the progress to date
          and how many more people there are to offer a vaccination to.
