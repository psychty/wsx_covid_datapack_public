          The COVID-19 vaccination programme began in England on the 8th
          December 2020.
        </p>
        <p>
          To begin with vaccinations were administered in NHS hospital hubs
          although from the 14th December, vaccinations were also administered
          through local vaccination services such as GP practices and then in
          care homes from the 21st December. In the new year (from 11th January
          2021) Vaccination Centres such as sports stadiums also started
          providing vaccinations.
        </p>
        <p>
          Vaccine supplies are growing as are the local centres which are
          delivering them. However, it is anticipated that it will take until
          summer/autumn months of 2021 before all adults have been offered a
          COVID-19 vaccine. The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation
          (JCVI) advise the government on the groups that should be prioritised
          for vaccination. JCVI advises that the first priorities for the
          vaccination programme should be the prevention of COVID-19 mortality
          and protecting health and social care staff and systems. Secondary
          priorities include vaccination of those at increased risk of
          hospitalisation and at increased risk of exposure, and to maintain
          resilience in essential public services. New data on infections as
          well as new vaccines and strains of the virus may prompt revisions in
          the advice on prioritisation from the JCVI.
        </p>
