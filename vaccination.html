          The COVID-19 vaccination programme began in England on the 8th
          December 2020.
        </p>
        <p>
          To begin with vaccinations were administered in NHS hospital hubs
          although from the 14th December 2020, vaccinations were also administered
          through local vaccination services such as GP practices and then in
          care homes by the end of the year. From 11th January
          2021, Vaccination Centres such as sports stadiums also started
          providing vaccinations and throughout 2021, mobile units were also deployed to support the vaccination programme.
        </p>
        <p>Over time, younger cohorts began being invited whilst priority was given to those in clinically extremely vulnerable groups.</p>
        <p>
          By December 2021, anyone aged 12 and over could book a single dose of a COVID-19 vaccination. Those aged 16 and over would also be able to book a second dose and those aged 18 and over would be able to book a third or booster vaccine dose. The programme was expanded substantially in response to a new variant of COVID-19 designated Omicron.

          The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) advise the
          government on the groups that should be prioritised for vaccination.
          JCVI advises that the first priorities for the vaccination programme
          should be the prevention of COVID-19 mortality and protecting health
          and social care staff and systems. Secondary priorities include
          vaccination of those at increased risk of hospitalisation and at
          increased risk of exposure, and to maintain resilience in essential
          public services.
        </p>
        <p class="side_important">
          On 26th February 2021, the JVCI advised that an age based population
          strategy should be adopted for further rolling out the vaccine
          programme without prioirtising new occupation groups.
        </p>

          The UK does not have a population register. We have used a denominator
          provided by the NIMS service for estimating the population in each
          area. These are our best guess at the number of people in the
          population, using sources such as GP practice registers and it is
          possible that they do not capture groups of people who are not
          registered with GPs including people who are homeless.

          Ensuring that vaccination coverage is high overall as well as within
          underserved communities is essential for successful delivery of the
          COVID-19 vaccination programme just like any disease control and
          elimination strategy.
        </p>
        <p>
          Inequalities are systematic differences in the status or distribution
          of resources between different population groups that are unfair or
          avoidable. We know that some groups may be more or less likely to get
          a vaccination because of factors such as access to transport,
          employment, education, ethnicity, as well as bariers related to
          language.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whilst this page contains information on uptake by age and by
          neighbourhood location across Sussex, we have created a suplementary
          analysis page to explore some of the inequalities in uptake of the
          COVID-19 vaccine that we can see using the publicly available data on
          uptake. This can be found on our

          The weekly publication of vaccination data by NHS England includes
          broad age groups. Currently, whilst those in younger age groups are
          not yet eligible, anyone aged under 25 years old are grouped together.
          Over time, as more age groups become eligible for the vaccination, it
          is expected that more groups will be available.
        </p>
        <p>
          The figure below shows the number of individuals (in the orange bars)
          who have received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine in West
          Sussex by age group. This figure also includes (in the dark grey bars)
          the number of people who have yet to receive their vaccination based
          on the population estimates from the NIMS service. This show that
          among older age groups, there are relatively fewer people yet to
          receive their vaccination compared to younger groups.
