          The COVID-19 vaccination programme began in England on the 8th
          December 2020.
        </p>
        <p>
          To begin with vaccinations were administered in NHS hospital hubs
          although from the 14th December, vaccinations were also administered
          through local vaccination services such as GP practices and then in
          care homes from the 21st December. In the new year (from 11th January
          2021) Vaccination Centres such as sports stadiums also started
          providing vaccinations.
        </p>
        <p>
          Vaccine supplies are growing as fast as possible as are the local
          centres which are delivering them. However, it is anticipated that it
          will take until summer/autumn months of 2021 before all adults have
          been offered a COVID-19 vaccine.
        </p>
        <p>

          The data in this section come from NHS England and are collected
          through the National Immunisation Management Service (NIMS). It will
          be updated every week, on a Thursday, with data up to the previous
          Sunday.

          The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) advise the
          government on the groups that should be prioritised for vaccination.
          JCVI advises that the first priorities for the vaccination programme
          should be the prevention of COVID-19 mortality and protecting health
          and social care staff and systems. Secondary priorities include
          vaccination of those at increased risk of hospitalisation and at
          increased risk of exposure, and to maintain resilience in essential
          public services.
        </p>
        <p class="side_important">
          On 26th February 2020, the JVCI advised that an age based population
          strategy should be adopted for further rolling out the vaccine
          programme without prioirtising new occupation groups.

          The first table shows the number of people who have received at least
          one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine by age group in West Sussex
          districts.<b>
            It should be noted that we do not know exactly how many people have
            been offered a vaccine or how many are eligible (e.g. some health
            and social care staff of any age are eligible, or those who are
            clinically vulnerable) and so cannot say if uptake is better or
            worse in some areas than others.</b

          the time of vaccination.

          Some areas have more older people and care homes and so these areas
          will likely show as having more people with vaccinations as these
          populations were prioritised to receive.
        </p>
        <p>
          Using population estimates can help to understand coverage in the
          population. However, this does not help us to say how many people have
          had the vaccine, who are currently eligible for it, which will vary
          from area to area.
        </p>
        <p>
          The UK does not have a population register. We have used the latest
          available (2019) mid year population estimates from the
          <a
            href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/populationandmigration/populationestimates"
            >Office for National Statistics</a
          >
          to calculate these rates. These are our best guess at the number of
          people in the population, and it is likely that they underestimate
          some groups (particularly older groups).
