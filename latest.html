    <h4 class = 'content_top'>Age-specific rates of COVID-19 cases</h4>
    <!-- <div class = 'content'>
    </div> -->
  
    <div class="content">
      <p>The age distribution of confirmed COVID-19 cases is important as we have a good idea that whilst all age groups are susceptible to catching the virus, being older is thought to be a risk factor in becoming severely unwell with the virus.</p>
      <p>We have seen from the national data that in the earlier waves of the pandemic, it was primarily older groups who were catching the virus, with a shift over the summer months to younger groups as more of society opened up and particularly as schools, colleges, and universities welcomed students back to classrooms.</p>
      <p>From the end of October 2020, the UK government began publishing the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases by age group at local level. We have used these data to present a range of views of the age-specific confirmed transmission in West Sussex and other areas such as the South East region and England.</p>
      <p>The first figure shows the 10 year age-specific rates over time in West Sussex. You can change the area using the drop down menu on the figure. Each line is coloured by age (see the key on the right). If you hover over a line or dot, the rest of the lines will fade and information about the number of cases and the age-specific rate (a method of standardising populations for comparison) at a given date.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class = 'right-sidebar'>
      <p class = 'side'>Note that although we have tried to smooth out daily variation by using a rolling 7-day rate, at local levels when cases are still fairly low, there can be a lot of unsteady variation from day to day among some age groups. This can make the lines jump up and down. This is more so for lower tier areas and to a lesser extent for the county level. You may notice that the lines look much smoother at regional and national levels.</p>

      <h4>Age bands</h4>
      <!-- <p class = 'side'>Age band key</p> -->
      <div id = 'age_band_key_figure'></div>
    </div>
  
    <div class = 'content'>
      <p>There are similar patterns in the age-specific rates over time for West Sussex, South East region, and national data with rates among those aged 80+ far above other groups early in the pandemic. Following a dampening down of rates for all groups in the summer, younger cohorts rapidly exceeded the growth in cases of other groups from September onwards (potentially due to education settings but also likely due to hospitality venues such as bars and restaurants reopening).</p>
      <p>It should also be considered that changes have occurred partly as test capacity and eligibility increased. Over time, more people were tested who were not displaying symptoms and these asymptomatic cases (perhaps picked up through workplace testing, or as a result of contact tracing) tended to be younger. It is possible that wider testing earlier in the pandemic may have identified many more younger aged cases of COVID-19.</p>
      <p>Notwithstanding changes in testing, those aged 20-29 have continued to be key drivers of new infections in recent weeks and months whilst rates among 10-19's appear to be levelling off.</p>
      <p>There has not been such a significant increase in infections among those aged 0-9 and the next figure shows a more detailed view of younger age groups. Again, you can change the area using the menu</p>
    </div>
  
    <div class = 'right-sidebar'>
      <p class = 'side'>The change in age-distribution of cases may be partly explained by different testing regimes with early testing only conducted among those who were symptomatic and often only among those who were hospitalised by the virus and as the testing capacity increased, more people were tested who did not have symptoms of a more severe illness.</p>
