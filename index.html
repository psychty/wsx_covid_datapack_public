    <p>The figure below shows the daily confirmed cases of Covid-19 over time by area (showing West Sussex by default), but you can change this to any lower tier area within the county as well as the South East region and England for comparison. The black line represents the rolling average number of new cases confirmed in the previous seven days.</p>
    <p>Case results are generally published in the afternoon and represent cases reported up to 9am of the reporting day. However, cases are assigned to the date on which the specimen was taken rather than when it was reported. It would be very unlikely that a specimen would be taken on the day of reporting with results returned by 9am. It can take as many as four days for results to be reported (e.g. specimens taken on 1st August may not be reported until the 5th). As such, we consider the last four days as incomplete as more cases may be added to the totals for these days.</p>
    <p>The figure includes key dates when changes to testing capacity and eligibility were announced. These are adapted from The Health Foundation <a href = 'https://www.health.org.uk/news-and-comment/charts-and-infographics/covid-19-policy-tracker'>Covid-19 Policy Tracker</a>.</p>

  <h4 class = 'content_top'>Age-specific rates of COVID-19 cases</h4>
  <div class = 'content'>
  </div>

  <div class="content">
    <p>The age distribution of confirmed COVID-19 cases is important as we have a good idea that whilst all age groups are susceptible to catching the virus, being older is thought to be a risk factor in becoming severely unwell with the virus.</p>
    <p>We have seen from the national data that in the earlier waves of the pandemic, it was primarily older groups who were catching the virus, with a shift over the summer months to younger groups as more of society opened up and particularly as schools, colleges, and universities welcomed students back to classrooms.</p>
    <p>From the end of October 2020, the UK government began publishing the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases by age group at local level. We have used these data to present a range of views of the age-specific confirmed transmission in West Sussex and other areas such as the South East region and England.</p>
    <p>The first figure shows the 10 year age-specific rates over time in West Sussex. You can change the area using the drop down menu on the figure. Each line is coloured by age (see the key on the right). If you hover over a line or dot, the rest of the lines will fade and information about the number of cases and the age-specific rate (a method of standardising populations for comparison) at a given date.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class = 'right-sidebar'>
    <p class = 'side'>Note that although we have tried to smooth out daily variation by using a rolling 7-day rate, at local levels when cases are still fairly low, there can be a lot of unsteady variation from day to day among some age groups. This can make the lines jump up and down. This is more so for lower tier areas and to a lesser extent for the county level. You may notice that the lines look much smoother at regional and national levels.</p>

    <h4>Age bands</h4>
    <p class = 'side'>Age band key</p>
    <div id = 'age_band_key_figure'></div>
  </div>

  <div class = 'content'>
    <p>There are similar patterns in the age-specific rates over time for West Sussex, South East region, and national data with rates among those aged 80+ far above other groups early in the pandemic. Following a dampening down of rates for all groups in the summer, younger cohorts rapidly exceeded the growth in cases of other groups from September onwards (potentially due to education settings but also likely due to hospitality venues such as bars and restaurants reopening).</p>
    <p>It should also be considered that changes have occurred partly as test capacity and eligibility increased. Over time, more people were tested who were not displaying symptoms and these asymptomatic cases (perhaps picked up through workplace testing, or as a result of contact tracing) tended to be younger. It is possible that wider testing earlier in the pandemic may have identified many more younger aged cases of COVID-19.</p>
    <p>Notwithstanding changes in testing, those aged 20-29 have continued to be key drivers of new infections in recent weeks and months whilst rates among 10-19's appear to be levelling off.</p>
    <p>There has not been such a significant increase in infections among those aged 0-9 and the next figure shows a more detailed view of younger age groups. Again, you can change the area using the menu</p>
  </div>

  <div class = 'right-sidebar'>
    <p class = 'side'>The change in age-distribution of cases may be partly explained by different testing regimes with early testing only conducted among those who were symptomatic and often only among those who were hospitalised by the virus and as the testing capacity increased, more people were tested who did not have symptoms of a more severe illness.</p>

    <p id = 'england_cumulative_text'></p>
    <p>The first figure in this section shows a scatter plot of every lower tier local authority in England represented by a dot with the most recent 7-day incidence rate per 100,000 population along the x axis (from left to right) and the percentage change in cases from the previous 7 days on the y axis (from bottom to top).</p>
    <p>This figure uses a rate per 100,000 to standardise populations across areas (because some areas are much bigger or more densely populated than others) and using a rolling 7-day period helps to smooth out any large variation in daily cases due to operational issues such as test processing at weekends. This is useful for seeing the current picture (compared to other areas) and how the cases have changed over the recent past and if they are decreasing or increasing. You can use the slider to look at previous days going back to the start of September 2020.</p>
    <p>The district and boroughs of West Sussex are highlighted here to make it easier to see local differences. The England rate is also highlighted in black. Hover over a dot to find out more.</p>

    <h4>Rates and change</h4>
    <p class = 'side_important'>The rolling 7 day total excludes the very recent few days as these are considered incomplete</p>
    <p class = 'side'>The closer to the left of the chart an areas is, the lower the 7 day incidence rate, and the closer to the bottom of the chart, the smaller the change from the previous week.

    <p>Data source: <a class = 'highlight_dl_link' href = 'https://coronavirus-staging.data.gov.uk' >https://coronavirus-staging.data.gov.uk</a></p>
    <p>Interpreting the percentage change value is actually easier if an area has at least some cases each week rather than having periods with no new cases. For example, an area with zero cases one week and two cases the next is perhaps better than having one case in one week and two in the next, yet the percentage increase is impossible to show from a starting value of zero. Equally, no change can mean two weeks of no new cases, or one case each week or 10.</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>The NHS Pathways dataset outlining the number of triages made to NHS 111 or 999 for COVID-19 symptoms has been suggested as a potential early warning indicator of an increase in potential cases, although it is not based on any outcomes of tests for COVID-19.</p>
    <p>There are a few caveats to be aware of when using this information. The data are not counts of people but rather assessments, and people with symptoms might not use this or might use it multiple times over the course of their symptoms (and maybe not at the start of their symptoms). People were encouraged initially NOT to call NHS 111 to report COVID-19 symptoms unless they were worried but instead were asked to complete an NHS 111 online triage assessment. Moreover, the criteria for inclusion on this pathway changed over time, particularly in the early weeks of the pandemic.</p>
    <p>However, this data may give some indication of the symptom reporting locally and a view of service contacts and an early view of people concerned about their symptoms.</p>

  <!-- <div class="content">
    <p>Following a national lockdown in England between 5th November 2020 to 2nd December 2020 areas returned to a tiered system allocating each local authority across the country to one of three tiers with a review of each areas placement every 14 days. However, on Saturday 20th December, the UK Government announced a fourth tier (Stay at home) to try to limit the spread of rapidly rising rates of COVID-19.</p>
    <p>West Sussex has been placed in the highest tier <b>(Stay at home tier 4)</b>. A full breakdown of the Tier 2 restrictions can be found on the <a href = 'https://www.gov.uk/guidance/local-restriction-tiers-what-you-need-to-know'>GOV.UK website</a>.</p>
    <p>The map below shows how restrictions vary across England. Tier 1 areas are shaded yellow, whilst Tier 2 areas are light blue, Tier 3 (very high) is dark blue and the highest tier (Tier 4 - stay at home) is purple.</p>
    <div id = 'ltla_restrictions_map'></div>
    <p>The map covers restrictions outlined by the UK government for England. Local authorities also have statutory powers to issue "directions" which impose prohibitions or restrictions on premises, events and public spaces.</p> 
  </div>
    <h4 class = 'content_top'>Returning to schools in 2021</h4>
    <div class = 'content'>
    <p>On the 30th December 2020, the Department for Education set out new guidance for schools and childcare settings. Its premise is to enable settings to prepare programmes for testing staff and pupils over the coming weeks using lateral flow device tests.</p>
    <p>To support this, the guidance indicates that in the week commencing 4th January 2021, secondary schools should only provide education on site to vulnerable children and children of critical workers whilst prioritising remote education to those pupils in exam years and where possible other pupils. The following week (commencing 11th January), remote education should be available to all pupils and all pupils should expect to return to on site education from the 18th January.</p>
    <p>Primary schools in some local authorities are also requested to restrict on site education to children of critical workers and vulnerable children with a review of restrictions by the 18th January 2021.</p>
    <p>The map below shows which areas (highlighted in red) will have primary schools remaining closed for all but vulnerable children and children of critical workers.</p>
    <div id = 'ltla_primary_schools_map'></div>
    <p>Early years settings should be available as normal from January 2021. Shielding advice is currently in place in tier 4 areas, and so all children still deemed clinically extremely vulnerable are advised not to attend school.</p>
  </div> -->
  <div class = 'content'>
  <p>On 4th January 2021, the Prime Minister announced a third national lockdown in England, issuing a stay at home message with education settings largely closed for face-to-face lessons to all except vulnerable children and children of critical workers</p>
