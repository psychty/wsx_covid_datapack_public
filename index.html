<div class = "content" id = 'content_size'>
<p>This pack brings together information relating to COVID-19 in West Sussex.</p>
<p>West Sussex County Council Public Health Department monitors information on a daily basis, and summary packs will be published weekly. Links are provided to public data sources available, with a summary of current sources available below.</p>
<p>Local authorities currently have access to some information that is not in the public domain, which may be due to small numbers or due to data being provisional.</p>
<p>The landscape of available data is changing all the time, and we hope to be able to publish as much as possible.</p>
<p id = 'data_recency'></p>
<!-- <p>In some parts of his data view, we do compare the most recent seven day period (including incomplete days) to the number of cases in the previous week to show how cases are changing. This may help to identify areas that are potentially increasing, and we would want to investigate this as soon as possible rather than wait for five days.</p> -->

<h4>Daily case changes and initial peaks</h4>
<p>The figure below shows the daily confirmed cases of Covid-19 over time by area (showing West Sussex by default), but you can change this to any lower tier area within the county. The black line represents the rolling average number of new cases confirmed in the previous seven days. The last five days of data are greyed out and should be treated as incomplete as more cases may be added to these days.</p>
<p>The figure includes key dates when changes to testing capacity and eligibility were announced. These are adapted from The Health Foundation <a href = 'https://www.health.org.uk/news-and-comment/charts-and-infographics/covid-19-policy-tracker'>Covid-19 Policy Tracker</a>.</p>

<div class= 'main' id = 'heatmap'>
<h2 style = "padding-left: 25px;"></h2>
<div class = 'content'>
<p>The next table and visualisation shows the most recently recorded confirmed cases and the number of new confirmed cases by day from pillar 1 (NHS and PHE laboratories) and pillar 2 (commercial testing) combined. You can toggle between viewing the coloured tiles as actual confirmed cases or as confirmed cases per 100,000 population (crude, all age population as at 2018). </p>
<p>Given the differences in population sizes across West Sussex, you might naturally expect there to be more cases in one area than another. Viewing the cases per 100,000 allows you to compare across areas as if they had the same population size.</p>
<h4 id = 'summary_cases_title'></h4>
</div>
<div class = 'right-sidebar'>
<p>The cumulative cases are taken from the most recently available date, although number of confirmed cases in a single day (a proxy for new cases) is taken from six days prior (latest complete date).</font></p>
<p>A Surge in cases can in part be due to the amount of testing done locally from one day to the next. We do not currently have information on the total number of tests being conducted locally.</p>
