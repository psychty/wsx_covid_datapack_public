<p>This pack brings together information relating to COVID-19 in West Sussex.</p>
<p>West Sussex County Council Public Health Department monitors information on a daily basis, and summary packs will be published weekly. Links are provided to public data sources available, with a summary of current sources available below.</p>
<p>Local authorities currently have access to some information that is not in the public domain, which may be due to small numbers or due to data being provisional.</p>
