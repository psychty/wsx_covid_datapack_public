        <p>
          The majority of COVID-19 testing in the UK to date has been Polymerase
          chain reaction (PCR) testing which is lab-based and tests for the
          presence of SARS-CoV-2 virus (rather than testing for the body's
          immune response or antibodies). This data shows the number of people
          who received at least one PCR test in the previous 7 days, as well as
          the percentage of people who received a PCR test in the previous 7
          days who had at least one positive PCR test result (the positivity
          rate). People are only counted once in a 7 day period.
        </p>

        <p>
          Lateral flow device (LFD) virus tests are another type of COVID-19
          test that look for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 virus. These are also
          swab tests, like the PCR tests, although they give results in less
          than an hour, without the need for laboratory processing. LFD tests
          are generally used for mass and routine testing of people who do not
          have COVID-19 symptoms. They are aimed at identifying individuals who
          may be infectious asymptomatic carriers and potential transmitters of
          the virus so these people can isolate and take the virus out of
          circulation in the community.

          A higher percentage of positive tests could suggest higher
          transmission, and perhaps that there are more people with coronavirus
          in the community who have not been tested yet, which could further
          indicate a need for conducting a higher number of tests. However, it
          could also be that a change in positivity is related to different
          groups of people coming forward for testing. It is likely a mixture of
          several reasons.

      <h4 class="content_top">How testing has changed over time</h4>
      <div class="content">
        <p>
          The overall number of virus tests conducted (using lab-based and rapid
          tests) each day is only available at a national level.
        </p>
        <p>
          For local areas (West Sussex or its districts and boroughs) we can
          only see the number of individuals tested using PCR tests in a seven
          day period or the total number of LFD tests conducted each day. These
          two measures cannot be combined into a single metric for how many
          people are being tested and must be considered separately.
        </p>
        <p>
          The next figure shows how the rolling 7-day number of individuals
          tested has changed over the course of the pandemic, and particularly
          how testing ramped up towards the end of 2020.

          The next figure shows the proportion of individuals with a positive
          result for the same area as in the above barchart. Comparing these two
          charts helps to contextualise testing. It shows that whilst the number
          of tests in the early stages of the pandemic were low, a much higher
          proportion of tests were positive (in some cases around half of
          tests). In more recent months, many more tests are conducted but fewer
          of those are positive.

          Whilst the number of individuals tested using the lab-based PCR tests
          is available for the whole of the pandemic (since February 2020), LFD
          testing in England only became widely available from the 21st October
          2020.
        </p>
        <p>
          As such,
          <b
            >the time period for the next figure (number of LFD tests conducted)
            is much smaller (for the last few months only).</b
          >
          Note also that data are available for very recent days (up to the day
          before). Whilst test results are much quicker to obtain for LFD tests
          compared to PCR tests, it is expected that the totals for the last few
          days will still not be complete due to delays in getting results into
          the national data systems.
